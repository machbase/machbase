This tutorial demonstrates how to receive JSON data from an external MQTT broker and store the data into another bridged database.

**Preparation**

We will use `mosquitto` as the external MQTT broker.
If you need to install `mosquitto`, please visit its [homepage](https://mosquitto.org).

We assume that the `mosquitto` server is running on `127.0.0.1:1883`.

## Create TQL file

Create a TQL file to handle incoming messages from the external MQTT broker.
Currently, the TQL script does not perform any significant processing; it merely receives the message payload and discards it.

Create a `/mqtt-bridge.tql` file using the file explorer in the machbase-neo web UI with the following content:

```js
STRING(payload())
DISCARD()
```

## Define MQTT bridge

Let's set up a bridge "mosquitto" in the machbase-neo as a MQTT bridge.

- Name: `mosquitto`
- Type: `MQTT`
- Connection String: `broker=127.0.0.1:1883 cleansession=true`

If you need more options for the connection string, please refer to the document [here](/neo/bridges/21.mqtt/).

{{< figure src="../img/mqtt-sqlite-bridge-mqtt.png" width="600" >}}

Test the connectivity by clicking the "Test" button as shown below. If you encounter any errors, adjust the "Connection String" to ensure a successful connection.

## Attach TQL to the MQTT bridge

After defining and testing mosquitto bridge, we can attatch the `mqtt-bridge.tql` TQL to the specific subject of the `mosquitto` broker.

Click the "New subscriber" button located below the "Test" button.

- Name: Enter `mosquitto-sub` as the name for this subscriber.
- Topic: Set the subscription topic to `demo/#`.
- Destination: Change the Destination Type to "TQL Script" and select or enter the TQL file we created.

Create the subscriber and set its state to "RUNNING" as shown below.

## Define destination DB bridge

Let's define another bridge to an external database. In this example, we will use SQLite. The process is similar for other types of databases, but the connection string options will vary depending on the database type.

- Name: `destdb`
- Type: `SQLite`
- Connection String `file:///tmp/mqtt.db`

{{< figure src="../img/mqtt-sqlite-bridge-sqlite.png" width="600" >}}

> If you only want to store the incoming data in machbase-neo, you do not need to define another bridge to an external database.

## TQL

Now, we are ready to write the actual TQL code that will execute whenever the `mosquitto` bridge receives messages published on the topic `demo/#` via the mosquitto server.

- Line 2-11: This JSON string is used for testing purposes when you execute a test run of this TQL. If `payload()` returns NULL because there are no "real" messages, the `??` operator takes the provided JSON string instead of NULL.

- Line 13: `SCRIPT({}, {})` is a TQL MAP function which executes the given Javascript. Please refer to the reference document in [here](/neo/tql/script/) for the details.

- Line 44: In this example, the SCRIPT MAP function handles all the tasks. There is no need for additional processing in the SINK function, but all TQL scripts must end with a SINK function. Therefore, we use the `DISCARD()` function to fulfill this requirement.

```js {linenos=table,hl_lines=["17-22","33-40"],linenostart=1}
STRING( payload() ?? `
    {
    "timestamp": 1732653071807,
        "message": {
            "totalCar": "1",
            "reason": "test",
            "total": "1",
            "resetTime": "2024-01-01T23:00:00Z",
            "scenario": "Scenario 0"
        }
    }
`)
SCRIPT({
    // Initialization code block:
    // This code block executes once for every new message that arrives,
    // before the first record is passing to the main code block.
    err = $.db({bridge:"destdb"}).exec("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS DATA ("+
        "TS INTEGER,"+
        "TOTAL_CAR INTEGER,"+
        "REASON TEXT,"+
        "TOTAL INTEGER,"+
        "RESET_TIME DATETIME)");
    if (err instanceof Error) {
        console.error("Fail to create table", err.message);
    }
}, {
    // Main code block:
    // This code block executes for every record.
    // In this example, a message contains only one record.
    //
    // parse json
    obj = JSON.parse($.values[0]);    
    err = $.db({bridge:"destdb"}).exec("INSERT INTO DATA VALUES(?, ?, ?, ?, ?)",
        obj.timestamp,
        parseInt(obj.message.totalCar),
        obj.message.reason,
        parseInt(obj.message.total),
        obj.message.resetTime,
        obj.message.scenario);
    if (err instanceof Error) {
        console.error("Fail to insert into table", err.message);
    }
})
DISCARD()
```


## Publish data

Prepare test data in a json file.

**mqtt-test.json**

```json
{
  "timestamp": 1732653071807,
  "message": {
     "totalCar": "3683",
     "reason": "car",
     "total": "3956",
     "resetTime": "2024-11-25T23:00:00Z",
     "scenario": "Scenario 1"
  }
}
```

Publish a message to the topic `demo/sensor_1` and the payload is the content of the file.

```sh
mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -p 1883 \
  -t demo/sensor_1 \
  -f ./mqtt-test.json
```

## Query bridged DB

Verify that the data has been stored in the destination database. The SQL editor in machbase-neo allows you to execute queries directly on the bridged database. Use the `-- env: bridge=destdb` comment to instruct machbase-neo to run the query on the bridged database instead of the machbase-neo itself.

```sql
-- env: bridge=destdb
SELECT * FROM DATA;
-- env: reset
```
